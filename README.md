Features an interactive noteboard built on React with two primary components: the AddNoteBar and Note components. All notes are editable using Markdown syntax. Uses FortAwesome icons, Bootstrap, the TextareaAutosize library, react-rnd for dragging and resizing, React Router for multiple boards, and Firebase for storing the notes in the cloud. One thing I could not implement was resizing the notes automatically to fit the text and/or image. 

Extra credit: resizable notes, z-index ordering (comes to front when clicked or dragged), local undo functionality, and multiple boards. Everything after the domain name in the URL is a unique identifier that corresponds to a particular board. Without an identifier, the app opens on the 'default' board.
