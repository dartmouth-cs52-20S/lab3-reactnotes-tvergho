Features an interactive noteboard built on React with two primary components: the AddNoteBar and Note components. All notes are editable using Markdown syntax. Uses FortAwesome icons, Bootstrap, the TextareaAutosize library, react-rnd for dragging and resizing, and Firebase for storing the notes in the cloud. 

Extra credit: resizable notes, z-index ordering (comes to front when clicked or dragged), local undo functionality.
